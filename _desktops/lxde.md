LXDE stands for "Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment" and lightweight it is, as LXDE manages to use fewer system resources than other desktop environments and still be full-featured, which makes it great for old or low-resource computers.

Unlike other tightly integrated desktops LXDE strives to be modular, so each component can be used independently with few dependencies.
