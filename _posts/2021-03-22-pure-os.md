PureOS is a general-purpose operating system from Purism with a focus on user privacy and security, coming with a variety of privacy features pre-enabled, and is adamant about leaving the user in control of their system.

Like some others, PureOS comes exclusively with 100% free and open source software, which gained it an endorsement from the [Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org/).
