Ubuntu has a very large userbase and community, and probably has the best name recognition of any distribution, as such it has a wealth of contributed support resources and the most attention from third-party app developers and companies.

Ubuntu's development is largely fueled by the Canonical corporation which provides both support for Ubuntu as well as the direction for the project as a whole.

Ubuntu has a large and vibrant community. There are many Ubuntu derivatives called [flavours](https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/flavours){:target="_blank"} which are community versions of Ubuntu that have been respun with different pre-installed software and desktop environments.
