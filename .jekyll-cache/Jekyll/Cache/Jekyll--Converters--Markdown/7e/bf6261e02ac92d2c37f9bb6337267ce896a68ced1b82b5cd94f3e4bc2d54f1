I"Š<p>LXDE stands for â€œLightweight X11 Desktop Environmentâ€ and lightweight it is, as LXDE manages to use fewer system resources than other desktop environments and still be full-featured, which makes it great for old or low-resource computers.</p>

<p>Unlike other tightly integrated desktops LXDE strives to be modular, so each component can be used independently with few dependencies.</p>
