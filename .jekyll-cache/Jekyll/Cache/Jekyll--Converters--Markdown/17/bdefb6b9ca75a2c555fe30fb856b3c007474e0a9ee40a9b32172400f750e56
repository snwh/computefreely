I"ğ<p>Trisquel is a 100% free software GNU/Linux operating system, meaning it comes with no proprietary software, a distinction that gained it an endorsement from the <a href="https://fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> as a entirely â€œfree as in freedomâ€ distribution.</p>

<p>Trisquel comes with a complete selection of programs that can be easily extended using a graphical installer. There are several editions available, including a â€œminiâ€ edition for netbooks and old computers.</p>
